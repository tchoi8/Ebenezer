	<h4>Date: February 4 - 25, 2021</h4>

		<p>In this workshop Taeyoon Choi will teach the students of Ebenezer School and Home for the Visually Impaired coding with HTML and JavaScript. 

		<br>

		Building upon the Touching the Internet workshop he led for the students in 2019, he will teach the students through four sessions of remote, online workshops.

		<br> 
		For the first two sessions of Poetic Coding workshop, students will learn how to create a simple website using HTML, and will learn to create ASCII art designs.

		<br>
		For the last two sessions, students will learn to create generative patterns using JavaScript. The output of the coding workshop will be made into a knit for tactile experience.
		
		<br>
		The workshop is organized by CHAT (Centre for Heritage, Arts and Textile), Hong Kong as a part of the exhibition Interweaving Poetic Code.
