  <pre> <3 <3 <3 </pre>
  
<p>
<pre><h3>&lt;pre> &lt;/pre></h3></pre>
  <ul>
  <li>Shortened word for 'preformatted text.' 
  <li>Text in a &lt;pre> tag is displayed in a fixed-width font
  <li>The text preserves both spaces and line breaks.
  <li>The text will be displayed as exactly as written in the HTML source code. This feature is different from &lt;p> tag which displays the text as a paragraph, and ignores spaces and line breaks.
  <li>&lt;pre> tag usually contains text with a unique format, code source with indentation format, special characters or ASCII Art. ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, which is a character encoding standard for the web.  
  <li> We are using &lt;pre> tag in order to create a knit based on the student's code. The output of the ASCII design will be printed onto a knit, so the students may touch their work in the end. The knit sample will be sent to students by February 22nd, for the 3rd workshop. 
  <li> Some screen readers cannot properly format pre elements, and may ignore the spacing and line breaks inside of &lt;pre> tag. It is recommended that you provide title or explanatory text along with the &lt;pre> tag.
   </ul>

<h3>Project examples</h3>


&lt;pre> tag can be used to create a graphic representation on a web page. This may not be accessible for the screen-reader users. 

<pre>

small house:
 
  []___
 /    /\
/____/__\
|[][]||||

</pre>

<p> The  &lt;pre> tag can be used to write with space, indentation and line breaks. </p>

<pre>

Small house 
 Small house
  Small house 
   Small house

</pre>    
<br>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>Create a story about items in your room with a &lt;pre> tag within 10 characters/ 10 lines constraint. An example:

<pre>

In my room 
I have a 
cat and a 
few plants
rose,
tulip, 
lily,
sunflower,
orchid, 
daffodil.

</pre> 

Another example that uses indentation within 10 characters/ 10 lines constraint.  

<pre>
I have 
 a cat 
  a dog 
   a bird   
a horse
 a bear 
  a pony 
   a shark 
    a deer
in my room.
</pre>   


Please consider the indentation, space, line breaks as part of the story. You can use ASCII characters such as !@#$%^&*()_+ by inserting special characters. 
We are hoping to knit your story on a piece of fabric so you can touch them. 

 
<p>
Please work on the homework until our next class. We will further explain the concept and use of ASCII in the class and give you time to work on the homework.
